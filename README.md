In this DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Point Source Catalog (LS-PSC), we provide a machine-learning score for the probability of a LS target being an unresolved, point source. This is a morphological classifier based on the LS photometry, and provide classification for $3\times10^9$ LS targets. LS-PSC is integrated into the real-time alert stream of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4).
